# PIC_Microcontroller_based_Electronic_Lock_System
Using Proteus and MikroC


This is a PIC Microncontroller based Lock System. I used PIC16F877A. The PIC is coded on MIkroC. The circuit diagram is attached as well. 
When the correct code is entered, green light glows and when wrong code is entered, red light. You will have 3 trials until you have to press reset button
